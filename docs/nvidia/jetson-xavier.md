If you’re an IoT Edge developer and looking out to build and deploy the production-grade end-to-end AI robotics applications, then check out a highly powerful and robust NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier developer platform. The NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Xavier™ Developer Kit provides a full-featured development platform designed for IoT Edge developers to easily create and deploy end-to-end AI robotics applications. This development platform is supported by NVIDIA JetPack and DeepStream SDKs, as well as CUDA®, cuDNN, and TensorRT software libraries.

Referring to AGX rightly as “Autonomous Machines Accelerator Technology” in loose term, the developer kit provides you with all the necessary tools you need to get started right away. And because it’s powered by the new NVIDIA Xavier processor, you now have more than 20X the performance and 10X the energy efficiency of its predecessor, the NVIDIA Jetson TX2.



At just 100 x 87 mm, Jetson AGX Xavier offers big workstation performance at 1/10 the size of a workstation. This makes it ideal for autonomous machines like delivery and logistics robots, factory systems, and large industrial UAVs. NVIDIA® Jetson™ brings accelerated AI performance to the Edge in a power-efficient and compact form factor. Together with NVIDIA JetPack™ SDK, these Jetson modules open the door for you to develop and deploy innovative products across all industries.

## Top 5 Compelling Features of AGX Xavier Kit

- Unlike NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB/4GB, NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier comes with inbuilt 32GB eMMC 5.1 storage. So, that means you really don’t need to buy separate SD card to install/run the operating system. Hence, saving your time to start with the developer kit flawlessly.
- Compared to NVIDIA Jetson Nano, the new Jetson AGX Xavier module makes AI-powered autonomous machines possible, running in as little as 10W and delivering up to 32 TOPs.
- AGX Xavier support up-to 6 cameras (36 via virtual channels). Cool, isn’t it?
- AGX Xavier comes with inbuilt 32 GB 256-bit LPDDR4x 136.5GB/s memory, much powerful to run applications like DeepStreaming.
