- DJI Tello has a brushed motor, which is cheaper than the brushless motor, but it’s also less efficient. (Sadly, brushed motors are known to burn out sometimes due to low quality or poor implementation. They’re also susceptible to rough impacts).
- Being a Non-GPS drone, it is very stable. Video quality is quite decent and landing is also accurate. Also fly it during calm winds or no winds conditions otherwise it’ll sway away with he wind. Good for indoors as well and to click some good selfies.
- DJI Tello is controlled using an application on an iOS or Android mobile phone. It is also possible to control via Bluetooth joystick connected via application.
